# Travel Request v4 - Getting Started

Concur Request automates the spend request and approval process for both travel and everyday expenses, giving you the data you need to accurately track and better control spending. By increasing visibility into planned expenses and up-to-date budget data, you can make strategic spending decisions before any spending actually occurs. The Request API provides many possibilities, particularly Requests creation and transition into the approval workflow.

Version 4.0 of Request API works only with the new [Authentication API](/api-reference/authentication/apidoc.html).

## Overview <a name="overview"></a>

The Request v4 API exposes five different resources:

Resource|Description
---|---
Request|You can read, create, update or delete a Request and get the list of existing Requests.
Workflow|You can perform action in the approval workflow of a Request (submit, approve, cancel...)
Expected Expense|You can read, create, update or delete an expected expense, and get the list of expected Expenses for a specific Request.
Request Policy|You can get the list of existing Request policies.
Travel Agency|You can get the description of a Travel Agency office.

These resources are used to manage documents used for pre-spend authorizations within Concur Request.

## Dependencies <a name="dependencies"></a>

SAP Concur clients must purchase Concur Request in order to use this API. This API may require for some use cases to consume the following additional SAP Concur APIs:

* [User profile](/api-reference/profile/v1.user.html), to retrieve the `userId` - required in most of the endpoints when accessed via a Company Token.
* [List], to retrieve the `listItemId` - required in the management of custom fields related to list items. Currently in externalisation process, please liaise with List API owner team for further update.

This API supports both company level and user level access tokens.

#### Company Access Token
