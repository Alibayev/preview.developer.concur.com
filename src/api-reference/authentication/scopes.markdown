# Scopes

Scope is a parameter as defined in the OAuth 2.0 standards (RFC6749) to enable a client to specify the scope of the access request. The value of the scope parameter is expressed as a list of space-delimited, case-sensitive strings although some implementations of scope uses a comma-delimited format. Scopes limit access for OAuth2 tokens and do not grant any additional permission beyond that which the client already has.

Scopes apply to applications only. Scopes play a crucial part in defining the ultimate access to a resource by a User.
