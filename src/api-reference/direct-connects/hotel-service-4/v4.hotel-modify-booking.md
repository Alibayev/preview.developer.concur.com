# Hotel Modify Support For CHS

{% include prerelease.html %}

## Overview

This document describes the workflow that will be used if a CHS supplier wants to implement support for modifying hotel booking. As of now, SAP Concur supports only modification of dates with possibility of changing other attributes in the future. The supplier can choose to support this feature by implementing the Hotel Service [v4 `modify` endpoint](./v4.endpoints.html#modify-). 

## Workflow

At a high-level, the workflow consists of:

- If `modify` is supported by CHS supplier and booking is marked as `modifiable`, user is provided with option to change dates for hotel booking and user updates the dates (checkin/checkout/both).
- SAP Concur invokes [`rate-details`](./v4.endpoints.html#rate-details-)  (used as `reshop` request) using same `ratePlanId` as used in original booking along with `confirmationCodes` that provides all confirmation codes and pin associated with booking.
- CHS supplier provides price details for the new dates based on confirmation codes and/or original `ratePlanId`. Hotel room/product is expected to be the same as original booking. Note that `ratePlanId` in response can be different from original booking.
- SAP Concur UI presents change in cost and new pricing to user for review. 
- User accepts and confirms the change request. 
- SAP Concur invokes [modify](./v4.endpoints.html#modify-) endpoint with new dates and `ratePlanId` from previous response along with confirmation codes and pin.
- CHS supplier updates the booking with new dates and returns the updated booking details.

Below is the sequence diagram for the flow:

## Requirements for CHS Supplier

- Supplier is expected to set [`isModifiable`](./v4.schemas.html#-hotelbooking) flag to `true` in the booking response if they support `modify` feature for a given booking.
- Supplier will need to support `reshop` request via [`rate-details`](./v4.endpoints.html#rate-details-) providing detailed pricing for new dates on already booked hotel and rate-plan.  
- Supplier will need to support `modify` request via [`modify`](./v4.endpoints.html#modify-) endpoint to update the booking with new dates.
