## <a name="overview"></a>Description

This API is designed to help partners build out-of-the-box financial integrations which can be self-installed by customers with little or no assistance from SAP Concur Global Services. SAP Concur provides an extensible financial integration framework to ensure a consistent, high-quality customer experience and lower cost for partners. This framework includes outbound, financial data and access to standardized APIs that transfer inbound data from the ERP without files or manual data entry.


> ***Limitation***:
> This API is available to selected partners who have been granted access by SAP Concur. Access to this documentation does not provide access to the API. The API is available in North America Production environment.
