# Accounting Integration v4 - Getting Started

{% include prerelease.html %}

This API is designed to help users build out-of-the-box financial integrations that can be self-installed by customers with little or no assistance. We provide an extensible financial integration framework to ensure a consistent, high-quality customer experience and lower cost for users.
