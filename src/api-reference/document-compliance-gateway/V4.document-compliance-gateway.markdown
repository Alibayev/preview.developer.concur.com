# Document Compliance Gateway v4

{% include prerelease.html %}

Document Compliance Gateway v4 API is designed to manage the transmission of the XML receipt file to the validating vendor. Vendors can implement the API to read the XML file sent to the SAP Concur system by the end user from an approved email, validate the XML against government records, and return the validation result. In addition, the vendor can read and parse the XML file to provide tax relevant data for creating expense entry.

The API supports an improved and efficient process for XML validation. The end user gets the XML validation result prior to expense creation preventing the unnecessary process, as well as, return and resubmission of the expense reports. The API also uses the data from the XML file to initiate the expense line item, saving the need for the user to manually type the information.

Currently, the API supports validating XML documents for Mexico called Comprobantes Fiscal Digital por Internet (CFDi).

```sh
curl --location --request GET 'https://integration.api.concursolutions.com/document-compliance-gateway/v4/tax-documents/{documentId}' -H 'Authorization: Bearer <JWT token>'
