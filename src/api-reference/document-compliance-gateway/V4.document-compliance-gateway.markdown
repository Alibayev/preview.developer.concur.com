# Document Compliance Gateway v4

Document Compliance Gateway v4 APIs on SAP Concurâ€™s AppCenter are designed to manage the transmission of the XML receipt file to the validating vendor. Vendors can implement the APIs to read the XML file sent to Concur system by the end-user from an approved email, validate the XMLs against government records and return the validation result. In addition, the vendor can read and parse the XML file to provide tax relevant data for creating expense entry.
The APIs supports an improved and efficient process for XML validation. The end-user gets the XML validation result prior to expense creation preventing the unnecessary process, as well as, return and resubmission of the expense reports. The APis also uses the data from XML file to initiate the expense line item, saving user the need to manually type the information.
Currently, the API supports validating XMLs documents for Mexico called Comprobantes Fiscal Digital por Internet (CFDi).
