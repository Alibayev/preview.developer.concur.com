# Spend Documents v4 

Spend Documents v4 provides APIs for ingesting & retrieving receipts and compliance documents. Certified vendors, who have achieved compliance, are able to utilize these APIs to submit compliant receipts to the SAP Concur platform. The workflow involves vendors posting a display version of the receipt, accompanied by the necessary data to generate a receipt. Following this, they can use the PUT API to upload the compliance document. After a successful posting and processing of the receipts, available expenses or receipts are created in Concur Expense.
