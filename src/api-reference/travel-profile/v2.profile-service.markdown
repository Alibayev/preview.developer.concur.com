# Travel Profile v2

The Travel Profile service consists of a set of resources that provide travel profile functionality customized in specific ways for developers, travel suppliers, and travel management companies (TMCs).

## [Profile v2](./v2.profile-resource.html)

These web services can be used to retrieve travel profile information for a specified user, or a list of travel profile summaries.

Available to Developers, travel suppliers, and TMCs.

## [Loyalty Program v1](./v1.loyalty-program-resource.html)

This web service can be used to update loyalty information for the user as entered in Concur.

Available to Travel suppliers and TMCs.

##  Configuration

Travel supplier or TMC partner applications must complete the [Concur application review process](/manage-apps/app-certification.html) before they can access production user data. Suppliers can only update Loyalty Program information for the programs that they manage. TMCs can access all the user's Travel Profile data, regardless of vendor.
