# Implementing User Provisioning APIs

You can use the System for Cross-Domain Identity Management (SCIM) user management API to enable automatic provisioning of users between your system and the SAP Concur platform. This document describes how to build a SCIM endpoint and integrate with the user provisioning service. The SCIM specification provides a common user schema for provisioning. When used in conjunction with federation standards, SCIM gives administrators an end-to-end, standards-based solution for access management.
