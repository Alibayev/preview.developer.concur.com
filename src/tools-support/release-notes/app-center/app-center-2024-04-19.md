As a leading on-demand platform in Southeast Asia and a pioneer in the multi-service ecosystem
model, Gojek offers various services, including transportation for daily commutes and business
trips.

One of the key features of the transportation service is Gojek Business Profile, which allows users
to separate business trips, streamline the reimbursement process, and integrate with their Concur
Expense accounts. There's no need to manually transfer your Gojek trip history to Concur Expense
anymore; everything is seamlessly automated.

To get started with Gojekâ€™s efficient and reliable solution for managing business travel, follow these
easy steps:

1. Download the Gojek app from the Apple Store or Google Play.
2. Create a Gojek account if you don't have one, or click "Log In" if you already have an
account. Then follow the next instructions.
3. Once your Gojek account is active, select the "My Profile" section and click on "Business
Profile."
4. Choose "Activate Business Profile" and fill in the required information such as name,
company name, and email address. Then proceed with the verification process.
5. After the Business Profile is activated, you can connect your SAP Concur account through
the available button on the main Business Profile page.

Experience Gojek's comprehensive transportation solutions such as:

* GoCar: An online taxi service with diverse options, from premium services (GoCar Luxe,
GoCar Comfort, GoCar Prioritas) to affordable options (GoCar, GoCar Hemat, & GoCar XL).
* GoRide: A convenient and fast online motorcycle taxi service (GoRide and GoRide Comfort).
  
Gojek works with Expense for Concur Standard and Expense for Concur Professional. It is coming
soon to the SAP Concur App Center under User Connections at [concur.com/appcenter](https://www.concur.com/app-center). For more information about the Gojek integration, visit [https://www.gojek.com](https://www.gojek.com).
