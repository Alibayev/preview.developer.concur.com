Build stronger business relationships through gratitude using the Thnks app.

With Thnks and SAP Concur, you can send personalized gestures of appreciation to your clients and partners, and effortlessly manage your expenses simultaneously. Thnks automatically syncs your receipts with your Concur Expense account and matches them with the relevant expense and credit card transaction details. This saves you time and hassle, and lets you focus on building stronger business relationships.

With an Enterprise Thnks account, you can easily connect it to your Concur Expense account by clicking “Connect.”

Thnks works with Expense for Concur Standard and Expense for Concur Professional.
