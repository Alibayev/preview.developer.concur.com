# API Release Notes, February 2023

## New This Month

### Planned Change: Financial Integration Services (FIS) v4 added fields to the Invoice Document Schema

FIS v4 will now include additional fields that can be used to not only better troubleshoot issues, but also adds compliance value. The API was changed to include following fields:

* `policyName` - the name of the policy for the invoice which can now be found on the `requestHeader` block.
* `externalPolicyId` - the ID associated with the Invoice policy to which an invoice belongs which can now be found on the `requestHeader` block.
* `vendorTaxID` - the Vendor Tax ID field required for some countries to provide government compliance with valid vendor invoices, which can now be found on the `requestHeader` block.

## Ongoing

### Planned Change: New SSL Certificate for *.concursolutions.com and *.api.concursolutions.com

As part of our weak cipher removal project, we have issued new *.concursolutions.com and *.api.concursolutions.com certificates. We will change the certificate by Feb 16, 2023 5PM PST. Know that most customers do not pin the certificate, and we are reaching out proactively only as a precaution.

Any customer who has pinned the current certificate will need to update to the new certificate prior to Feb 16, 2023 5PM PST. If you have pinned the certificate and it is not updated, your organization and users would experience disruption to SAP Concur solutions.

**Clients who have not pinned the certificate do not need to take any action as the new certificate will automatically be updated when it becomes available.**

Clients who pin their security certificates can obtain the new certificates from the following locations:

New Intermediate certificate and Root certificate for both (*.concursolutions.com and *.api.concursolutions.com) are
*	[Intermediate: DigiCert TLS RSA SHA256 2020 CA1](https://cacerts.digicert.com/DigiCertTLSRSASHA2562020CA1-1.crt.pem)
*	[Root: DigiCert Global Root CA](https://cacerts.digicert.com/DigiCertGlobalRootCA.crt.pem)

NOTE: Certificate pinning is not recommended. However, if there is a need to pin the certificate, please pin the Root certificate instead of End certificate as End certificate expires every year.

If you need the whole chain (End, Intermediate, Root) you can access it at:.

* *.api.concursolutions.com
   * [https://assets.concur.com/concurtraining/cte/en-us/api-concursolutions-com-chain_ECDSA.pem](https://assets.concur.com/concurtraining/cte/en-us/api-concursolutions-com-chain_ECDSA.pem)
   * [https://assets.concur.com/concurtraining/cte/en-us/api-concursolutions-com-chain_RSA.pem](https://assets.concur.com/concurtraining/cte/en-us/api-concursolutions-com-chain_RSA.pem)
* *.concursolutions.com
   * [https://assets.concur.com/concurtraining/cte/en-us/concursolutions-com-chain_ECDSA.pem](https://assets.concur.com/concurtraining/cte/en-us/concursolutions-com-chain_ECDSA.pem)
   * [https://assets.concur.com/concurtraining/cte/en-us/concursolutions-com-chain_RSA.pem](https://assets.concur.com/concurtraining/cte/en-us/concursolutions-com-chain_RSA.pem)

**Note**: If you are pinning the End certificate you need to pin both ECDSA and RSA certificates.

### Vendor v3.1 API Available

Vendor 3.1 has the same functionality as the previous Vendors v3 API, with the exception of now aligning with [Export Control and Sanctions Compliance](https://www.sap.com/about/agreements/export-statements.html) regulations. The API was changed to ensure the following 3 fields are mandatory: Currency Code, Country Code, State/Province please review the schema documentation for further clarification. Vendor v3 is being deprecated and decommissioned, users will have until March 31, 2023 to migrate to the latest version of the API.

### Move from the Travel Request External Validation Callout v1 to the Event Subscription Service (ESS)

With the decommission of the Concur Request v1 API on May 31st, 2023, calling the Travel Request External Validation Callout v1 will no longer be possible. Please use the Event
Subscription Services (ESS) to subscribe to the [Request events](https://developer.concur.com/api-reference/ess/v4.event-subscription.html).

### Planned Change: New Client SSL Certificate for ESS webhook.api.concursolutions.com

In an effort to ensure the ongoing security of our products and services, ESS will be issuing a new webhook.api.concursolutions.com SSL certificate.

Any customer who has pinned this expiring certificate will need to update to the new certificate prior to the expiration date. If the pinned certificate is not updated prior, your organization and users will experience disruption to SAP Concur products and services. Customers who have not pinned the certificate do not need to take any action as the new certificate is updated automatically. Most customers do not pin the certificate.

NOTE: As an enhancement to our Security and Compliance program, this certificate will be updated on an annual basis.
