# API Release Notes, June 2025

## New This Month

### Preview: Detokenizer (DTK) v5 API

The FIPS Compliant v5 Credit Card Detokenization API will be set to launch within the CCPS environment for IBCP customers. This compliance-driven initiative aligns with the Federal Information Processor Standards (FIPS) to ensure robust protection of sensitive data, per U.S. federal requirements. For customers with entities in CCPS and IBCP card programs, the new Detokenizer (DTK) functionality will be integral to the payment file process. 

>**Note:** The current v4 API service will remain unchanged for other environments.

**Overview**

The Detokenizer service ensures secure transmission of sensitive data (card number) to customers as part of the remittance file creation process running at caller applications like ICS and CWS, in which the full, unmasked credit card number is required for the correct application of payments.

**API Details**

There are two APIs which are developed as part of Detokenizer (DTK) v5 and they must be called in sequence. 

The Detokenizer v5 API exposes the following resources and these must be called sequentially:

Resource|Description
---|---
RSAPublicKey|Retrieves the RSA public Key via public key API
Credit Card Account Details|Retrieves the credit card number via Detokenizer API

The first DTK v5 API will return the RSA public key and version of the RSA public key. The caller needs to wrap their symmetric key using this public key and this wrapped symmetric key needs to be passed to the second DTK v5 API along with the version earlier mentioned, and the mandatory credit card GUID received from client request to provide encrypted credit card account number.
