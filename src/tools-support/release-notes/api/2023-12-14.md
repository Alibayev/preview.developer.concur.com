# API Release Notes, December 2023

## New This Month

### Now Available: Expense Exceptions v4 API

We have released an API to manage exceptions on reports, entries, and allocations. The API will include PUT, GET, and DELETE exceptions for reports, entries, and allocations. These will enable a partner application to programmatically add a exceptions to a report, entry, or allocation, read those exceptions, and remove an exception (if it was added to the report, entry, or allocation by the API). 

### Ongoing

### Planned Change: Ready for Integration Event

Authorized consumers of the Financial Integration Service v4 API can subscribe to a new event that will notify them when a financial posting document is ready and available for import. This new event is available through the Event Subscription Service v4 by subscribing to the topic `public.concur.financialintegration`.

### Planned Change: New Client SSL Certificate and Public Key for ESS webhook.api.concursolutions.com

In an effort to ensure the ongoing security of our products and services, ESS will be issuing a new webhook.api.concursolutions.com SSL certificate and public key.  
 
Any customer who has pinned previous certificate will need to update to the new certificate. If the pinned certificate is not updated prior, your organization and users will experience disruption to SAP Concur products and services. Customers who have not pinned the certificate do not need to take any action as the new certificate is updated automatically. Most customers do not pin the certificate. 
 
Please note that public key is changing as well. Applications that using digital signature validation will be affected and need to adopt new public key. 
 
New certificate and public key will be published on the SAP Concur Developer Center.  
 
>NOTE: As an enhancement to our Security and Compliance program, certificate will be updated at least once a year. 

 
### Decommission of User v1 Password Endpoint

The decommission of the User v1 password endpoint will occur on July 28th, 2023. Clients that have not yet moved to the Concur Request v4 APIs will have until July 28th, 2023 to make the required changes. After the decommission date, the endpoint will no longer be available in Production, in accordance also with the [SAP Concur API Lifecycle & Deprecation Policy](/tools-support/deprecation-policy.html).

### Decommissioning of Password Provisioning

Beginning August 2nd, 2023, password provisioning for user accounts will not be supported. Any passwords provisioned through flat file, XLS, or the User v1 API will be ignored. New users will be directed to the “Forgot Password” link for their initial login.

### Decommission of Password Provisioning via File Import

The decommission of password provisioning via file import will occur on October 1st, 2023. This will affect flat file imports, XLS imports, and the User v1 API. Please work with your SAP Concur representative if you have any questions.

### Decommission of Existing Concur Request APIs (v1.0, v3.0, v3.1)

The decommission of the v1.0, v3.0, and v3.1 APIs is planned to conclude soon. Users that have not yet migrated to the Concur Request v4 APIs are strongly encouraged to make the required developments. Decommission is now ongoing since June 1st, 2021 and the legacy Concur Request APIs (v1.0, v3.0, v3.1) will only be supported on a limited case-by-case basis. A new decommission date will be defined and the legacy Concur Request APIs (v1.0, v3.0, v3.1) will no longer be available into Production, in accordance with the SAP Concur API Lifecycle & Deprecation Policy.

API Timeline for v1.0, v3.0, v3.1:

* Deprecation – March 1, 2020 – May 31, 2021
* Decommission – Since June 01, 2021

The Concur Request APIs v1.0, v3.0 and v3.1 only support the previous authentication method, which is not best security practice and does not meet the OAuth2 standards. In addition, the previous versions of the Concur Request APIs provided limited possibilities for moving a Request through the approval workflow, as well as managing custom simple & connected list fields. These issues are resolved with the new Concur Request v4 APIs.

In addition, SAP has run a backward compatibility project between the current Concur Request APIs and the new Concur Request v4 APIs (not iso-compatibility) in order to have the vast majority of use cases managed in the previous versions also be managed in the Concur Request v4 APIs.

Please work with your Concur representative to move from your current legacy Concur Request APIs (v1.0, v3.0, v3.1) towards the Request v4 APIs.

### Move from the Travel Request External Validation Callout v1 to the Event Subscription Service (ESS)

The Travel Request External Validation Callout v1 API was designed to work with the Concur Request v1 API that is in the process of being decommissioned. Users relying on the Travel Request External Validation Callout v1 are strongly recommended to move to the Event Subscription Services (ESS) in order to subscribe to the [Request events](https://developer.concur.com/api-reference/ess/v4.event-subscription.html).

Please work with your organization to move from Travel Request External Validation Callout v1 to Event Subscription Services (ESS).

For new users willing to take advantage of the Concur Request External Validation Workflow Feature, please work with your Concur representative to rely on the Concur Event Subscription Service and configure the Concur Request Workflow accordingly.
