### Identity v4 Now Includes Three SCIM Service Configuration Endpoints

Clients will have a programmatic option to retrieve SCIM-based services information through three [SCIM standard](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7644#section-4) endpoints to help discovery of [our SCIM-based provisioning service features](/api-reference/user-provisioning/v4.user-provisioning.html).

* [/Service Provider Configuration](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7644#section-4) - describes the SCIM specification features available in the SAP Concur platform.
* [/Schemas](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7644#section-4) – retrieve information about the resource schemas supported by the SAP Concur platform.

### Planned Change: List Item Bulk V4 API

We will be releasing the List Item Bulk V4 API. The List Item Bulk v4 API allows for creating and modifying multiple list items in a list. The currently published List Item v4 API provides functionality for creating, updating, and deleting a single list item. 

### Planned Changes: Approve Report, Send Back Report, and Recall Report V4 APIs

We will be releasing the Approve Report, Send Back Report, and Recall Report v4 APIs. These APIs will replace the (expense report workflow action v1.1 API)[/api-reference/expense/expense-report/post-report-workflow-action.html]. These v4 expense report workflow APIs are functionally similar to their v1 Post an Expense Report Workflow Action counterparts but will be available as separate actions. 

## Ongoing

The decommission of Concur Request v1 API is planned on May 31st, 2023.
