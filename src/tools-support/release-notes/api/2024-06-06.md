# API Release Notes, June 2024

## New This Month

### Planned Change: Spend Documents v4 Update

We will be releasing an update to Spend Documents V4.  This will allow partners to directly post compliance documents on behalf of a SAP Concur user to Concur Expense.

* POST endpoint to allow posting of new receipts.
* PUT endpoint to allow upload of compliance documents.
* GET endpoint to allow retrieval of receipt details by `ReceiptId` or by `ImageId` and `CompanyId`.

### Now Available: Cost Object Workflow

The Workflow v4 API page has been updated to include the new Cost Object workflow functionality. This endpoint allows external callers to view a report's approver related cost objects within a cost object approval workflow.

### Planned Change: New SSL certificate for *.concursolutions.com and *api.concursolutions.com

To ensure the ongoing security of our products and services, the *.concursolutions.com and *.api.concursolutions.com SSL certificates are updated on an annual basis. The current certificates will expire as follows:
* 23:59 GMT on July 11, 2024 (*.concursolutions.com)
* 23:59 GMT on August 11, 2024 (*.api.concursolutions.com) 
  
SAP Concur plans to issue new certificates as follows:
* 6PM PST on June 20, 2024 (*.concursolutions.com)
* 6PM PST July 25, 2024 (*.api.concursolutions.com)

Clients who have not pinned the expiring certificate do not need to take any action as their expiring certificate will be renewed automatically. **Most clients do not pin the certificate.**

>**NOTE**: SAP ICS customers who follow the certificate handling processes described in the following note do not need to take any action: [2914977 - FAQ: Concur Certificates, Authentication, and Connectivity](https://me.sap.com/notes/2914977).

Clients who have pinned an expiring certificate must update to the new certificate before the new certificate is issued at 6PM PST on June 20, 2024 (*.concursolutions.com) or at 6PM PST on July 25, 2024 (*.api.concursolutions.com). 

Clients who have pinned the certificate and who do not update it with the new certificate before it is renewed, will experience disruption to SAP Concur products and services.

**Configuration / Feature Activation**

>**IMPORTANT**: Certificate pinning is not recommended, and you do so at your own risk. To support security for SAP Concur solutions, security certificates are renewed regularly. Pinned certificates are not renewed automatically and, if a pinned certificate is not renewed before it expires, the pinned certificate can cause a disruption of service. 

To avoid disruption of service, clients who pin their security certificates must pin both the RSA and ECDSA certificates. Clients may obtain the new certificates from the following web pages:

***.concursolutions.com**
* [https://assets.concur.com/concurtraining/cte/en-us/concursolutions-com-chain_ECDSA.pem](https://assets.concur.com/concurtraining/cte/en-us/concursolutions-com-chain_ECDSA.pem) 
* [https://assets.concur.com/concurtraining/cte/en-us/concursolutions-com-chain_RSA.pem](https://assets.concur.com/concurtraining/cte/en-us/concursolutions-com-chain_RSA.pem)

***.api.concursolutions.com**
* [https://assets.concur.com/concurtraining/cte/en-us/api-concursolutions-com-chain_RSA.pem](https://assets.concur.com/concurtraining/cte/en-us/api-concursolutions-com-chain_RSA.pem)
* [https://assets.concur.com/concurtraining/cte/en-us/api-concursolutions-com-chain_ECDSA.pem](https://assets.concur.com/concurtraining/cte/en-us/api-concursolutions-com-chain_ECDSA.pem)

>**NOTE**: If you are not sure whether your concursolutions.com certificate is pinned, consult with your IT department.

## Ongoing

### Planned Change: PGP Key for File Transfers to be Replaced

Files transferred to SAP Concur solutions must be encrypted with the SAP Concur public PGP key. 

* A new PGP key, key ID 8C51C89E, will be available in the clientâ€™s root folder beginning on or before May 24, 2024. The file name will be concursolutions.asc.
* The current key, key ID 9AFF10B5, will expire on September 4, 2024, and should no longer be used.
  
> More information about migrating from the legacy key (key ID D4D727C0) to the new key (key ID 8C51C89E), will be provided in the June 2024 release notes.

The expiration date of the current key (key ID 9AFF10B5) cannot be changed. To ensure that file uploads continue to be processed after the key expires on September 4, 2024, clients must migrate to the new PGP key (key ID 8C51C89E) before the expiration date. 

If you are unable to migrate to the new key (key ID 8C51C89E) before September 4, 2024, you can manually upload files using the Import / Extract Monitor feature.

> For more information about the Import / Extract Monitor feature, refer to the [Shared: Import/Extract Monitor User Guide](https://www.concurtraining.com/customers/tech_pubs/Docs/_Current/UG_Shr/Shr_UG_IE_Monitor.pdf).

**Admin Experience**

When it becomes available, an administrator with the required file transfer credentials can log into the file transfer site to retrieve the public PGP key, concursolutions.asc, from the root directory. 

**Configuration**

When it becomes available, your internal file transfer administrator can add the new key to their PGP keyring and start using it to encrypt files being transferred to SAP Concur. If you require assistance, please contact SAP Concur support.

> For more information, refer to the [Shared: File Transfer for Customers and Vendors User Guide](https://www.concurtraining.com/customers/tech_pubs/Docs/ConcurPremier/UG_Shr/Shr_UG_FileTransfer.pdf).
