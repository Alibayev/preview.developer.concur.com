# API Release Notes, October 2024

## New This Month

### Now Available: Workflows v4 Submit a Specific Report Added

The Workflows v4 API is releasing a new PATCH operation allowing submittal of expense reports.

### Now Available: External Event Support for Spend and Travel Profile Changes

In October, we have released three external event topics to inform users when an users spend or travel profile is created, updated, or deleted within their company. After subscribing to the topic, users will be updated when a new identity is created with a URL to the identity. Update events will include the updated attributes included within the event and a URL to the identity to retrieve values.

## Ongoing

### Preview: New Client SSL Certificate for ESS webhook.api.concursolutions.com

**Overview**

In an effort to ensure the ongoing security of our products and services, on October 22, 2024, ESS will be issuing a new webhook.api.concursolutions.com SSL certificate.

Any customer who has pinned this expiring certificate will need to update to the new certificate prior to the expiration date. If the pinned certificate is not updated prior, your organization and users will experience disruption to SAP Concur products and services. Customers who have not pinned the certificate do not need to take any action as the new certificate is updated automatically. Most customers do not pin the certificate.

> As an enhancement to our Security and Compliance program, this certificate will be updated on an annual basis

**Configuration / Feature Activation**

Please consult with your IT department to check if this applies to you.
